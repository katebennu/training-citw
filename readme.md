## Preparations

We will build mobile apps (Android or iOS) during the training, but no prior knowledge in mobile app development is required. We only expect everyone to be familiar with JavaScript and overall web development, including git and npm.

Youâ€™ll be coding sometimes in a browser, sometimes in your favorite IDE/ text editor. The mobile apps we will build should run on an actual device, like a smartphone or a tablet.

Make sure that your laptop and phone have everything installed because we do not have much extra time during the program. And like said, if you have any problems with having everything installed come an hour earlier (9 am.) so you will get help for that.

## Mandatory equipment

* Laptop, with functioning WiFi (preferably Mac or Linux, but development is possible on Windows also)
* Phone or a tablet device. Must run either Android or recent iOS
* USB cable to connect the phone to your computer (e.g. your charger)

## Install these (for the first day):

* IDE or text editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, etc)
* Node.js (Install version 8.x preferably through nvm)
* Git
* Chrome (for debugging the apps)
* On your mobile device: Expo app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779))

## Test your environment

* Open snack.expo.io on your computer's browser
* Open the QR code in that site
* Scan the QR code with the Expo app on your mobile device
* Check that it opens the example correctly

## Install these (for the second day):

* (If you have an Android phone): [install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), then inside it, install the SDK for your phone's OS version
* (If you have an iPhone): install XCode (through the App Store)
* `npm install -g react-native`
